## DONE

### shell command

- cd [path] changes the current working directory.

- ls [path] prints a listing of a specific file or directory; ls on its own lists the current working directory.

- pwd prints the userâ€™s current working directory.

- / on its own is the root directory of the whole file system.

- cp [old] [new] copies a file.

- mkdir [path] creates a new directory.

- mv [old] [new] moves (renames) a file or directory.

- rm [path] removes (deletes) a file.

- * matches zero or more characters in a filename, so *.txt matches all files ending in .txt.
